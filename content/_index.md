# The Noises Inside {#jdouglas}

The Noises Inside involves the initial compositions of producer, J Douglas which are then performed and expanded upon by an eclectic selection of rotating musicians and artists. 

> _Well, it actually fits the themes I tend to explore pretty well. I don't know what is going on in my own head most of the time! So having the Noises Inside be strangers just made sense in a way. - *J*_
